2. Customer Churn:
Relevant Dashboard: Customer Behavior.
Potential Insights: Understand the rate of customer churn, identify customer segments or geographic areas with higher churn risk, analyze trends in active vs. churn-risk customers, and potentially identify factors correlated with churn (e.g., purchase frequency, profitability trends).   

3. Inefficient Marketing Spend:
Relevant Dashboard: Customer Behavior (Segment Profitability vs. Marketing Cost).
Potential Insights: Determine which customer segments generate the highest profit relative to marketing costs, identify underperforming segments where marketing spend might be inefficient.

4. Poor Product Performance:

6. Inventory Management Problems (Implied):
